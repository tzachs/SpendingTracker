This is android app helping to keep track of spending during the month.
What differentiate it from other spending tracker is that it has it's auto reminder for each regular spending.
For example, if you take the bus each day and pay each day 5 $, the program will audo pop up a question asking if you 
took the bus. Answering Yes will auto add the expanse you made to that day spending.

It's that simple... :)
